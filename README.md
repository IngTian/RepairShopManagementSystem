# Repairshop Management System
## ECSE 321 Project Group 11

Welcome to the ECSE 321 Group 11 project.

Please check the wiki for information on the architecture of the system.

***

## Scope of Project

This system application is designed to help an auto repair shop with its business. 
The application shall allow a mixture of owners, administrative assistants and customers to 
interact in order to accommodate the customers' needs for the appointments for their cars.
The scope of the project of the group of ECSE 321 is to develop the software system for a appointment booking app.
The project is organized in four Agile sprints. 
The final deliverable consists of an Android app and a website for this appointment booking app.
It should allow the owners to check the schedule with the appointments booked by the customers.
And the administrative assistants should be able to set the available time in the schedule for the customers to choose for their appointment time.
The project scope also includes a persistence layer to save and load all the necessary data into a database.

This application supports the scenarios described for every stakeholder. 
All functionality of the system needs to be accessible via the web frontend for respective stakeholders. 
In addition, a mobile (Android) frontend shall allow the execution of the most important functionality for the given stakeholder, i.e. it shall have both read and
write access to the backend via RESTful service calls. 
External systems or services are not required to be integrated.
